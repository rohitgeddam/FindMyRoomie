## How to contribute
To contribute to the repository, the repository has to be forked into your own Github account and then cloned to create a local repository in your machine. The instructions to setup the project is described in [README](https://github.com/rohitgeddam/FindMyRoomie/blob/main/README.md). We strongly advice to create a new branch for each of your contribution which will be merged after the contribution has been reviewed. 

## Writing Code
Please follow the Black code format that has been maintained in the codebase of the repository. Looking at existing code should help you understand the structure better.

### Before you push
Please ensure you run tests and flake8 to check for errors before you push to github. Use black to format code.

## Pull request process
1. Make a pull before pushing the changes to a new branch that is dedicated for the change you are going to make.
2. After pushing your contribution to the new branch, make sure all tests are passing before making a pull request to merge the changes with the develop branch. Owners of the repository will look out for new Pull Requests and review them timely. Another layer of merge happens from develop to main branch after final review. 
3. Kindly add required documentation in README.md and comment on the PRs to elaborate on the changes that were made. 

## Additional tips!
